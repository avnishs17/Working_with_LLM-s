      "The sky appears blue to us during the daytime because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Light Composition**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it contains all the colors of the visible spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Scattering**: As this light travels through the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light. When light hits these small molecules, it scatters in all directions due to its interaction with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Wavelength**: The shorter wavelengths of light (such as blue and violet) scatter more than the longer wavelengths (like red and orange) because they interact more strongly with the small gas molecules. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described this phenomenon in the late 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Color Perception**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light, which has the shortest wavelength among all visible colors and thus scatters the most, becomes distributed more evenly throughout the atmosphere compared to other wavelengths. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions around us, creating the sky's blue appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Time and Atmospheric Conditions**: The color of the sky can change based on time and atmospheric conditions. During sunrise and sunset, when sunlight passes through more of Earth's atmosphere (thus scattering off more particles), the light has to travel longer distances, and as a result, it encounters water droplets in clouds or aerosols in the air, which scatter the shorter wavelengths more than usual. This is why the sky often appears red or orange during these times.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Atmospheric Dust and Pollutants**: The presence of atmospheric dust, smoke from wildfires, pollution particles, and other substances can also affect how the light scatters. These particles absorb certain wavelengths, making the sky appear more hazy or changing its color to a different shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Space Observations**: Outside Earth's atmosphere, like in space, the sky is black because there are no atmospheric particles to scatter sunlight towards observers on the surface of planets, including our own.\n"
